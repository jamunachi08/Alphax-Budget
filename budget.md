# A budget is 

a financial plan that outlines expected income and expenses over a certain period of time (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually).

It helps individuals, businesses, and governments manage money, control spending, and achieve financial goals.

Key points about a budget:

Income side → how much money is expected to come in (sales, salary, investments, funding).

Expense side → how much money will be spent (rent, salaries, materials, utilities, projects).

Balance → the difference between income and expenses.

If income > expenses → surplus (extra money).

If income < expenses → deficit (shortage).

# Types of budgets:

- Personal Budget – managing household income and expenses.

- Business Budget – tracking company revenues, operating costs, and investments.

- Government Budget – planning public revenue (taxes) and expenditures (services, infrastructure).

- Project Budget – allocating funds for a specific project.

👉 In ERPNext (since you work with it), a Budget is a document that defines spending limits for a Cost Center and Account within a Fiscal Year. It can be used to monitor and control expenses, e.g., warn or stop transactions like Purchase Orders if they exceed the allocated budget.
